# Taskify

This project is based off an online course for TypeScript and React. Following this project I built out the functionality of Taskify, but changed the state management of the app.

The tutorial uses useState for state management and passing state down through props. Instead I took this opportunity to continue my understanding of Redux and its implementation using TypeScript. The app now uses Redux to manage state for tasks to do and task that are completed. I also implemented my own slice actions to manipulate state and follow the logic of the apps usage.
